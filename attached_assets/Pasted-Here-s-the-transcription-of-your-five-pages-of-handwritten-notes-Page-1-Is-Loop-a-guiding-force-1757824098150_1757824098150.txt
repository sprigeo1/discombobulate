Here’s the transcription of your five pages of handwritten notes:

Page 1
Is Loop a guiding force for Y.P. that deepens understanding about relationships: how to start, grow, maintain, and sustain over long periods of time? What are the foundations of strong relationships? How do trust, kindness, acceptance, and vulnerability strengthen relationships? How does Loop guide the development of these foundational components in Y.P.? What are the questions that can help Loop understand where a Y.P. is now in their relationships and where they might grow? How can Loop guide growth that inspires Y.P. to seek out and build meaningful relationships with the most important people in their lives? Maybe one of the first questions is: who are the most important people in your life?

Who qualifies as most important? Are the most important people (MIP) those who you trust, feel safe around, are willing to share important parts of your life with? How about people who are kind to you and who you show kindness to? Who are the people you want to talk with when you feel happy or sad? Who are the people who really seem to understand you? Who are the people who take you just the way you are? Can Loop guide Y.P. to build relationships with people that embody all of what I described above? As part of what Loop attempts to do, can it build/guide Y.P. to understand how they can become someone else’s MIP? And in doing this grow their own ability for kindness, compassion, trust, and thus vulnerability and acceptance?

Page 3
What is Loop’s purpose after it builds their constellation? Is the force Loop has something that will always be present and available to guide or as a guide in a Y.P.’s life? How can Loop fade into the background as personal relationships begin to shine brightly in the foreground of a Y.P.’s life? Can a Y.P.’s constellation of relationships continue to grow? Can it also change over time, extend, shrink, or if relationships dim or brighten? Once a star is formed it can never disappear entirely, but it might dim with energy returned to the relationship through micro-acts that serve to add strength to the relationship and then brighten the star (relationship) as that MIP.

Page 4
Is the goal to build meaningful relationships that are few and strong vs. many and weak? What questions can Loop ask a Y.P. when they want to add a new MIP (star) to their sky that will help them understand how to grow the relationship with this new addition to their constellation? If the purpose is to build and sustain relationships then is the most intentional action Loop can guide to help a Y.P. identify 1–3 MIP and grow relationships with this constellation of stars before adding more? Maybe one of the questions initially is: “Is there someone close to your age that is a MIP in your life? Is there someone older, an adult that is a MIP in your life?”

⸻

Page 5
Maybe we start out with 2 people and when the relationships with the two people begin to strengthen then Loop prompts the Y.P. by asking: “Is there another MIP in your life or someone you think could become an MIP?” Can then guide the Y.P. in how to grow this relationship while putting guardrails in place so that that prevent a Y.P. from being taken advantage of.
